# todolist

#### Internship task

<p>In this task I was first asked to make a TODO List. It was very new to me.</p><br>
<p>Later, I looked for video and Website materials and made a Simple TODO List application.</p><br>
<p>I was not clear with the Process how things were working.</p><br>
<p>The first tried application had Check and Delete Button.</p><br>
<p>Later I was asked to make a todo Application with Edit button to Edit the task that was displayed.</p><br>
<p>I got a advise as I should learn how CRUD operations work. Then I saw a video and referred many websites.</p><br>
<p>Then, I got some idea and I made this new TODO list with Edit button referring the codes from previously done Application.</p>
